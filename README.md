# Github Wrap

It's late 2025 and the year is closing out, which means every commit, every late night fix, every burnt coffee push and every green square finally gets its spotlight. Inspired by the vibe of a Spotify wrap but rebuilt for developers, this GitHub wrap turns your entire coding year into a clean, nostalgic retrospective.
It pulls in your commits, issues, pull requests, coding streaks, peak coding hours, languages you touched, repos you built, and all the tiny milestones you probably forgot about.
This is your yearly story told through your work, your curiosity, and your grind.
